# Experimental repository used to wish my friend a happy birthday! :)

In this repository, there includes 2 scripts that are to be used. This includes:

MainScripts.py
Doja.py

To run the python scripts, there are a few modules and libraries that are needed. For this I shall help you get them by a 
single line command that should be able to run on the Terminal and you will be good to go!


Enter this line in Terminal: 
git clone https://github.com/CabinOnTheIsle/shreya.git && cd Shreya && pip install -r requirements.txt

Then, Enter this line to use the first script:
python3 MainScripts.py

The bonus script is as follows:
python3 Doja.py

To use Terminal, remember that 'control^' + 'C' will end the running programe as it is a keyboard interrupt.
Incase anything goes wrong, please contact me and I will be happy to assist you.

Happy Birthday!
Yours truely,
CabinOnTheIsle
