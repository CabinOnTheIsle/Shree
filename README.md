# Experimental repository used to wish my friend a happy birthday! :)

In this repository, there includes 2 scripts that are to be used. This includes:

__MainScripts.py__

__Doja.py__

To run the python scripts, there are a few modules and libraries that are needed. For this I shall help you get them by a 
single line command that should be able to run on the Terminal and you will be good to go!


__()Enter this line in Terminal:__  

<git clone https://github.com/CabinOnTheIsle/shreya.git && cd shreya && pip install -r requirements.txt>

__()Then, Enter this line to use the first script:__

python3 MainScripts.py

__()The bonus script is for later and is as follows:__

python3 Doja.py

*To use Terminal, remember that 'control^' + 'C' will end the running programe as it is a keyboard interrupt.
Incase anything goes wrong, please contact me and I will be happy to assist you.*

__Happy Birthday!
Yours truely,
CabinOnTheIsle__
