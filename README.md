# Experimental repository used to wish my friend a happy birthday! :)

In this repository, there includes 2 scripts that are to be used. This includes:

MainScripts.py
Doja.py

To run the python scripts, there are a few modules and libraries that are needed. For this I shall help you get them by a single line command that should be able to run on the Terminal and you will be good to go!

To use Terminal, remember that 'control^' + 'C' will end the running programe as it is a keyboard interrupt. Incase anything goes wrong, please contact me and I will be happy to assist you.

Happy Birthday!
Yours truely,
CabinOnTheIsle
